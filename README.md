# Demo project for Valid8Me

## Overview
This is a quick REST API impl using spring boot, H2 and reactive web.

I was not able to complete this as some other things came up, but please ask any questions and make any critical comments as you see fit.
### Testing
No tests have been written. However, appropriate testing may be:
* BDD based on the requirements. Though they were thin, in real life they can be a bridge between what the business wants and what is technically delivered.
* Unit tests, testing individual components, using mocking frameworks where appropriate
* Integration tests to validate the application in its production-like environment.
* Performance/load testing, finding hotspots in application logic
* Penetration testing, assuming that there are any security requirements beyond basic ORM and VM safety.
